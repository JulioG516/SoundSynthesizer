# Sound Synthesizer 

This is a basic Sound Synthesizer implemented using `olcNoiseMaker.h`, a library created by Javidx9 for generating audio.

## Prerequisites
- C++ compiler
- `olcNoiseMaker.h` library

## Usage
1. Include the `olcNoiseMaker.h` library in your project.
2. Implement the sound synthesis logic using the library's functions and classes.
3. Set up the audio system and initialize the synthesizer in your application's entry point.
4. Start generating audio by providing a callback function that generates audio samples.
